# 🚗 Custom Road Network Simulator  

This project, developed as part of a **Simulation of vehicle behaviour in a city created in Unity engine**, provides a tool for designing and analyzing road networks.  
It allows users to **create and modify roads as custom splines, place traffic lights, and gather real-time traffic data**.  

## ✨ Features  

- **🛣️ Custom Road Creation** – Define roads using splines for flexible and realistic layouts.  
- **✏️ Road Editing** – Modify existing roads to fine-tune the network design.  
- **🚦 Traffic Lights Management** – Place and configure traffic lights for intersection control.  
- **📊 Traffic Data Collection** – Analyze key metrics, including:  
  - ⏳ Average waiting time at traffic lights  
  - 🚗 Number of vehicles in the system
